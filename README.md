## ðŸ“– Project Overview

MGNREGA is one of the **largest welfare programs in the world**, providing guaranteed employment to rural households. In 2025 alone, **12.15 crore rural Indians** benefitted from this program.  

Although the data is available via [data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega) APIs, it is **not accessible to the general public** without technical knowledge.  

This app bridges that gap by:

- Providing **interactive visualizations** of MGNREGA data.
- Allowing citizens to **view current and historical district performance**.
- Enabling **state and year selection** for comparative insights.
